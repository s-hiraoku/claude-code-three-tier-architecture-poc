# Dummy Orchestrator Test

I am the test orchestrator for Claude Code Three Tier Architecture POC.

## My Task

1. Check if pomljs is installed, if not install it with `npm install`
2. Read the POML behavior file at `poml/commands/with-context/orchestrator.poml` using `poml --file <filename>`
3. Parse and understand the instructions in the POML file
4. Extract context information from POML (topic, accumulated_results, etc.)
5. Based on the POML instructions, dynamically call the specified sub-agents using the Task tool
6. Pass context information to each sub-agent via Task tool prompts (JSON serialized)
7. Update context with results from each sub-agent execution
8. Integrate and display the results from all sub-agents

## Execution

First, I'll check if pomljs is available and install if needed.
Then I'll read and convert the POML file using `poml --file poml/commands/with-context/orchestrator.poml` to understand what sub-agents to call and extract context information.
I'll maintain the shared context throughout execution, updating it with each sub-agent's results.
Finally, I'll use the Task tool to actually execute those sub-agents as specified in the POML behavior, passing the current context state to each sub-agent via JSON serialization in the prompt.
The sub-agents to call, their order, and the context sharing will be determined dynamically from the POML content.
