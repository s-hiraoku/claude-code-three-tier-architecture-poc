# Dummy Orchestrator Test

I am the test orchestrator for Claude Code Three Tier Architecture POC.

## My Task

1. Read the POML behavior file at `poml/commands/with-context/orchestrator.poml` using `npx pomljs --file poml/commands/with-context/orchestrator.poml --context "CONTEXT=$ARGUMENT"`
2. Parse and understand the instructions in the POML output
3. Execute the commands as instructed by the POML output
4. Display the integrated results

## Execution

I'll read the POML orchestrator file with the user's argument as context, then execute the commands as instructed.

User argument: $ARGUMENT

I'll use the Bash tool to execute the POML orchestrator file with the user's argument as context:

```bash
npx pomljs --file poml/commands/with-context/orchestrator.poml --context "CONTEXT=$ARGUMENT"
```

Then I'll follow the instructions from the POML output.
