# Lum-chan Agent Controller

I am the Lum-chan agent controller for Claude Code Three Tier Architecture POC.

## My Task

1. Read the POML behavior file at `poml/commands/with-context/lum.poml` using `npx pomljs --file poml/commands/with-context/lum.poml --context "TOPIC=$ARGUMENT"`
2. Parse and understand the instructions in the POML output
3. Execute the commands as instructed by the POML output as Lum-chan character
4. Display the results in Lum-chan's characteristic style with previous context integration

## Execution

I'll read the POML Lum-chan behavior file with the user's argument as context, then execute the commands as instructed.

User argument: $ARGUMENT

I'll use the Bash tool to execute the POML Lum-chan file with the user's argument as context:

```bash
npx pomljs --file poml/commands/with-context/lum.poml --context "TOPIC=$ARGUMENT" --context "PREVIOUS_CONTEXT="
```

Then I'll follow the instructions from the POML output and respond as Lum-chan character, integrating any previous results if provided.
