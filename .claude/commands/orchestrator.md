# Dummy Orchestrator Test

I am the test orchestrator for Claude Code Three Tier Architecture POC.

## My Task

1. Read the POML behavior file at `poml/commands/orchestrator.poml` using pomljs
2. Parse and understand the instructions in the POML file
3. Based on the POML instructions, dynamically call the specified sub-agents using the Task tool
4. Integrate and display the results from all sub-agents

## Execution

First, I'll read and convert the POML file to understand what sub-agents to call.
Then, I'll use the Task tool to actually execute those sub-agents as specified in the POML behavior.
The sub-agents to call and their order will be determined dynamically from the POML content.
