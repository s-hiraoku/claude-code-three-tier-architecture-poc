# Dummy Orchestrator Test

I am the test orchestrator for Claude Code Three Tier Architecture POC.

## My Task

1. Check if pomljs is installed, if not install it with `npm install`
2. Read the POML behavior file at `poml/commands/orchestrator.poml` using `poml --file <filename>`
3. Parse and understand the instructions in the POML file
4. Based on the POML instructions, dynamically call the specified sub-agents using the Task tool
5. Integrate and display the results from all sub-agents

## Execution

First, I'll check if pomljs is available and install if needed.
Then I'll read and convert the POML file using `poml --file poml/commands/orchestrator.poml` to understand what sub-agents to call.
Finally, I'll use the Task tool to actually execute those sub-agents as specified in the POML behavior.
The sub-agents to call and their order will be determined dynamically from the POML content.
